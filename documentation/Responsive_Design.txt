for font-sizes:
	• 1rem = 1 x font-size of ROOT element
	• 1em = 1 x font-size of PARENT element

for margins and paddings:
	• 1rem = 1 x font-size of ROOT element
	• 1em = 1 x font-size of CURRENT element

1rem usually is 16px as browser default

Recommendations:
	• Use rem with font-size because it always looks at the root or HTML element for font-size . So, we don't need to worry about parent-child calculations as with em .
	• Use em with padding as em will adjust the padding based on the font-size of that element (good for button padding).
	• Use rem with margin if you want consistent space among all the adjacent elements.
